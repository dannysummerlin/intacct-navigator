# Intacct Navigator

Get more done in Intacct - list and search records or make new ones!

This extension helps you get to any Intacct page quickly.

Open the search bar and go straight to:
- [NEW FEATURE] Add tasks on the fly by typing "! <your task>"
- [NEW FEATURE] Search all records with "? <search terms>"
- Object List views with "List <Object>"
- Create a new record with "New <Object>"
- Go directly a Setup page by typing it's name
- Access Object customizations with "<Object> <Section>" (e.g. "Contact Fields")
- Go to your Home page with "Home"
- Switch between Lightning and Classic with "Toggle Lightning"
- Switch between Detailed and Simple mode with "Toggle Detailed Mode"
- Commands looking weird? Run "Refresh Metadata" to make sure you have what you need
- Login as another user with "Login as <partial match of username>"

All commands work with partial matches, for instance typing "li cas" will select "List Cases"

Press Enter or click on the option to run the command, or hold Ctrl or Shift and press Enter to open it in a new tab
